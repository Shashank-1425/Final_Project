# 📊 Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Analysis

This project is the **final deliverable** of my data analysis internship at **Elevate Labs**, where I developed a data pipeline and predictive model to estimate **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** using historical transaction data.

LTV helps businesses understand how valuable each customer is over time, enabling smarter marketing strategies, customer segmentation, and retention planning.

## Project Overview

This project walks through the complete analytical process of predicting customer lifetime value based on historical purchases. We employed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and regression modeling to segment users and forecast potential revenue per customer.

---

## Key Features

- ✅ Cleaned and processed raw transactional datasets
- 📊 Conducted EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- 🧾 Implemented RFM segmentation
- 🧮 Calculated Historical and Predicted Customer LTV
- 📈 Visualized LTV distribution and customer value tiers
- 🧪 Evaluated model performance with regression metrics

---

## 📊 Model Performance

We used a simple regression model to predict customer LTV based on key features like frequency and monetary value.

- **R² Score**: 1.00
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: 4.19 
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: 14.99

These baseline metrics reflect an initial LTV prediction model, which can be improved using more advanced machine learning techniques and additional feature engineering.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – for data wrangling
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – for visualizations
- **Scikit-learn** – for predictive modeling and performance evaluation
